## üí° Introduction

<img src="src/teaser-image-clc.jpg" alt="image_text" width="600"/>

We apply mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze cross-lingual inconsistencies in multilingual masked language models (MLMs). Our findings reveal that MLMs represent knowledge in a shared, language-independent space through most layers, transitioning to language-specific representations only in the final layers. Errors often occur during this transition, leading to incorrect predictions in the target language despite correct answers in others. These insights offer a lightweight and effective strategy for improving factual consistency across languages.

This repository contains our implementation, based on [llm-transparency-tool](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llm-transparency-tool), with shortcut methods adapted from [relations](https://github.com/evandez/relations). The dataset  is available in [this repository (coming soon)](https://github.com/boschresearch/KLAR-CLC).


## üîß Environment Setup
To run the framework, you need to set up your environment as follows:

```shell
conda create -n klar python=3.12.4
conda activate klar
```

Then install other required packages via:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚è≥ Running
Scripts for are provided in [`run_scripts`](run_scripts/). For example, to run the forward pass on samples in different relations:

```shell
sh run_scripts/run_llmtt.sh
```
To save the layer-wise hidden_states for similarity-based analysis:


```shell
sh run_scripts/save_hidden_states.sh
```
